Known to provoke asthma attacks (though the US FDA** do not recognise this) and urticaria (nettle rash) in children (the US FDA** estimates 1:10 000), altered states of perception and behaviour, uncontrolled hyper agitation and confusion; wakefulness in young children. Is known to inhibit zinc metabolism and interfere with digestive enzymes. Tartrazine sensitivity is also linked to aspirin sensitivity; used to colour drinks, sweets, jams, cereals, snack foods, canned fish, packaged soups and a dye for wool and silk..

Alcoholic drinks may contain the water soluble form (ammonium carmine), but the insoluble calcium carmine is found in a many more products. Other commercial uses include as an antineoplastic agent, as a 0.025% solution in concentrated H2SO4 for photometric and fluorimetric determination of B, as an indicator and diagnostic agent (gives colour reactions with Mg, Ge, Pb, Zr, Th, Mo, U).

It is the most commonly occurring metal in the earth&apos;s crust (8.3% by weight), and as well as being used in the food industry, is also used in the construction and aerospace industries, in aerosol cans and foil. Production of Al metal involves the following: (i) extraction, purification and dehydration of bauxite; (ii) the electrolysis of Al2O3 dissolved in molten cryolite.

The actual method of recovery from the ore depends on which metal is predominant in the ore but normally ends by electrolysis using one of two techniques, either the Moebius or Thum Balbach systems. Silver is used extensively in the photographic industry, as well as in silverware and jewellery, electrically, for silvering mirrors and in batteries.

Benzoic acid is also used in the manufacture of plasticisers, resin coatings and caprolactam. It is an antiseptic, antifungal, antipyretic agent, and can be used as an alkalimetric standard. Added to alcoholic beverages, baked goods, cheeses, gum, condiments, frozen dairy, relishes, soft sweets, cordials and sugar substitutes. Used in cosmetics, as an antiseptic in many cough medications and an antifungal in ointments; can cause asthma, especially in those dependant on steroid asthma medications. Is also reputed to cause neurological disorders and to react with sulphur bisulphite (222), shown to provoke hyperactivity in children and can cause asthma in those dependant on steroid asthma medications.

The incomplete combustion of organic compounds results in formaldehyde formation, hence smoked foods are preserved not only by phenolic substances present in the smoke, by the formaldehyde coating. It is also used as a disinfectant and a fungicide. Its main application is in the preparation of phenolic resins (or phenol-formaldehyde copolymers, e.g. bakelite). Formaldehyde is also used in the preparation of ribose. Other names: formalin, formic aldehyde, methylene oxide, oxomethane, paraform.

		<string>Petroleum derivative, BHA is a synthetic analogue of vitamin E and operates by reducing oxygen radicals and interrupting the propagation of oxidation processes. It is widely used as an antioxidant and preservative, and is prepared from p-methoxyphenol and isobutene. BHA can be used in baked products as it is stable at high temperatures, it is mainly used to prevent rancidity in fats and oils. Typical products include biscuits, cakes, fats and oils, cereals, pastry and pastry products, sweets, edible oils, chewing gum, fats, margarine, nuts, instant potato products, polyethylene food wraps; not permitted in infant foods, can provoke an allergic reaction in some people, may trigger hyperactivity and other intolerances; serious concerns over carcinogenicity and estrogenic effects, in large doses caused tumours in lab animals, banned in Japan in 1958, official committees of experts recommended that it be banned in the UK, however due to industry pressure it was not banned, McDonald&apos;s eliminated BHT from their US products by 1986.

		<key>code</key>
		<string>E338</string>
		<key>danger</key>
		<string>Orthophosphoric acid can only be obtained pure in the crystalline state and slowly undergoes dehydration to diphosphoric acid. Crystalline phosphoric acid has a hydrogen-bonded layer structure in which each molecule is attached to 6 others. Impure phosphoric acid has its main application in fertilisers, and also in the synthesis of pure phosphoric acid. In turn pure phosphoric acid is used in food, detergents, pharmaceuticals and metal treatment (e.g. pickling, cleaning, rust-proofing, polishing). Car bodies and electrical appliances are all protected against rust and blistering by the presence of a phosphatised undercoat. Phosphoric acid is used in the production of activated carbon, and may be used in soft drinks to give a sour taste.
&quot;Thermal&quot; phosphoric acid is made by oxidation of phosphorus in the presence of water vapour whilst &quot;wet&quot; acid is made by treating rock phosphate with sulphuric acid.
Phosphoric acid is added to food to enhance the antioxidant effects of other compounds present, and also as an acidity regulator. Typical products include carbonated beverages, processed meat, chocolate, fats and oils, beer, jam, sweets. Too much in diet leads to loss of calcium in bones and onset of osteoporosis.  In fizzy drinks it allows more carbon dioxide concentration without bottle burst.  Soft drinks, beer, cheese products, snacks, and most processed foods. Other names: orthophosphoric acid.
Phosphoric acid is banned in organic food and drinks. Phosphoric acid is a highly acidic ingredient in cola drinks, used to offset the extreme sweetness. The way the kidneys excrete it is by bonding it with calcium taken from the bones, which can then leave the bones porous and brittle, and increase the risk of osteoporosis. A study, published in the Archives of Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine in 2000, showed that athletic teenage girls who consume cola drinks have been found to have five times the risk of bone fractures of those athletic girls who do not consume cola drinks. Acceptable Daily Intake: Up to 70 mg/kg body weight. Phosphoric acid and phosphates can normally be consumed by all religious groups, vegans and vegetarians. Although animal bones are mainly made up of phosphates, commercial phosphate is not made from bones.</string>

		<string>Calcium salt of inosinic acid (E630), a natural acid, that is mainly present in animals. Commercially prepared from meat or fish (sardines). May also be produced by bacterial fermentation of sugars. Flavour enhancer. Inosinic acid and inosinates do not have the specific umami taste but strongly enhance many other flavours, thereby reducing the amounts of salt or other flavour enhancers needed in a product. Used in many products. Mainly used in low sodium/salt products. Acceptable daily intake (ADI): None determined. Inosinates may not be used in products intended for children under 12 weeks. Asthmatic people should avoid inosinates. As inosinates are metabolised to purines, they should be avoided by people suffering from gout. However, the concentrations used are generally so low that no effects are to be expected.</string>

		<string>Quillaia extract is a purified extract of the outer cambium layer of Quillaia Saponaria Molina, or Quillay Bark. The Quillaia tree is native to Peru and Chile, and cultivated in Northern Hindustan. Quillaia bark infusion has good foam capabilities due to the presence of saponin, a non-poisonous, white powder. Saponin is a glucoside which will yield quillaic acid and quillaia-sapotoxin upon decomposure. The latter products are both poisonous irritants, however it is the sapotoxin which foams upon shaking. Quillaic acid is also known as 3,16-dihydroxy-23-oxo-12-oleanen-28-oic acid. Used in the production of foam on non-alcoholic beverages. Use is banned in a number of countries.
